Testing methods:

1. Test the maximum connections the server can handle without dropping any packets
2. Test if the server can accept multiple connections at the same time
3. Test if HEAD, GET and POST requests can be successfully handled


Vulnerabilities:

1. By the Listen(sock, 1000) function, if the size of fd reaches 1000 and a connection request arrives, the client receives an ECONNREFUSED error
2. Potentially insecurity results from using HTTP instead of HTTPS
